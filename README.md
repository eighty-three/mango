# Mango
Local manga library (?) for my personal use, that is, the features are catered to my needs

## Features
* Automated downloader (aka time.sleep(x)) including scrapers for different sites

## Currently Doing
* UI to make titles I have saved easily searchable locally
* Page for the title has relevant info included (description, author, tags, custom fields e.g. notes, etc.)

## Maybe Next Time
* Include way to add new titles
* Add downloader for Mangadex instead of automating just other sites
* Add way of updating metadata? Maybe only for titles marked as ongoing
* Whatever comes to mind
