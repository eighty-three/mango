# Supported Sites
The specific scrapers are coded in a subpar manner (to say it lightly); once the html changes for that specific website it'll need some fixing. There aren't any APIs that I can use instead (or I don't know how to get them) so I just parse its html, some better than others.

MangaDex not included yet because their site is down so I can't test what I write, plus they said they're going to change the API so there's no point trying to write a scraper using their v3 API
